The `skillcdn` command reads a pack as an agent gets it over MCP, from a directory on this machine (ADR-0055): `skillcdn skills <directory>` prints what a client is told on connect and every skill and document, `browse`, `find`, `skill` and `file` print what `browse_repo`, `search_repo`, `load_skill` and `read_repo_file` give a model, rendered by the same functions with the reads named as the commands, or the JSON of the REST API with `--json`. A skill is printed whole. The directory is addressed as `local/<its parent>/<its name>`, or as `--as` says, and is verified. `@skillcdn/indexer` exports `readDirectory`, which reads a directory as the indexer reads a commit and which `check` now reads through; `@skillcdn/reader` exports `createMemoryIndex`, an index kept in memory and searched with the word rules of `@skillcdn/core`; the renderers of `@skillcdn/core` take `ToolWords`, the names of the four reads, with `MCP_TOOL_WORDS` as their default.
